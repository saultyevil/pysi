    """The purpose of this function is to use a base parameter file and to
    create directories containing parameter files with a different value to the
    given parameter. These values are given in grid.

    This function will only work with one parameter and grids of multiple
    parameters cannot be created.

    A backup of the original base pf is made just in case :-).

    Parameters
    ----------
    pf: str
        Path to the base Python pf
    parameter: str
        The name of the parameter for which a grid will be created
    grid: List[str]
        The values of the parameter to make a grid with
    name: str
        The name of the slurm file
    root: str
        The root name of the Python simulation
    ncores: int
        The number of cores which to use
    thours: int
        The number of hours to execute for
    flags: str
        The flags of which to execute Python with

    Returns
    -------
    pfs: List[str]
        A list containing the file paths to the newly created pfs.
